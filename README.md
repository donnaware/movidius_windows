How to use the Movidius Neural Compute Stick on Windows

Yes, it is possible to use the Movidius Neural Compute Stick (https://developer.movidius.com/) on windows.
The standard SDK for it is for Ubuntu or Raspian but with a little fiddling you can get it to work, here's how.


## Step 1:
The first step is to download one of the standard windows apps I have already compiled. I recommend starting with the Alexnet app.
That app will allow you to configure and test your stick and make sure the right drivers are installed.
